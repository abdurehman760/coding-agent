### **Phase 1: Environment Setup**
#### **Step 1: Initialize the Project**
- Create a new **NestJS** project:
  ```bash
  nest new langchain-bot
  ```
- Install necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install langchain openai @nestjs/config
  ```
- Set up a `.env` file for storing OpenAI API keys and other configurations.

#### **Step 2: Configure OpenAI Integration**
- Create a **ConfigModule** to load the `.env` file and configure OpenAI credentials.
- Write a simple service (`OpenAiService`) that integrates with the OpenAI API using LangChain.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Modules**
#### **Step 3: File and Directory Management Module**
- Create a `FileService` for:
  - Parsing a directory (`fs.readdir`).
  - Reading files (`fs.readFile`).
  - Writing files (`fs.writeFile`).
- Implement error handling for file operations (e.g., missing files, permission errors).

#### **Step 4: Command Execution Module**
- Build a `CommandService` using Node.js's `child_process`.
  - Functions:
    - Run shell commands (`exec`).
    - Capture output (success/error).
  - Example use cases:
    - Running `npm install`.
    - Creating a directory (`mkdir`).
- Add safety checks to prevent malicious commands.

---

### **Phase 3: AI-Powered Code Generation**
#### **Step 5: React Component Generator**
- Write a `CodeGeneratorService`:
  - Use LangChain’s LLM wrapper to interact with OpenAI.
  - Define a **prompt template** for generating React components.
    - Example Prompt:
      ```
      Generate a React functional component named {name} with props {props}.
      ```
  - Save generated code to a specified file using `FileService`.

#### **Step 6: File Editing Tool**
- Extend `CodeGeneratorService`:
  - Fetch file content using `FileService`.
  - Define a prompt to modify code based on user instructions.
    - Example:
      ```
      Here is the code: {code}
      Modify the API endpoint to include authentication.
      ```
  - Save the modified content back to the file.

---

### **Phase 4: LangChain Integration**
#### **Step 7: LangChain Tools**
- Build custom LangChain tools for:
  - File operations (`FileReader`, `FileWriter`).
  - Command execution (`CommandExecutor`).
  - Code generation (`CodeGeneratorTool`).
- Test each tool independently to ensure correct functionality.

#### **Step 8: LangChain Chains**
- Use LangChain’s `SequentialChain` or `SimpleSequentialChain` to chain tasks:
  - Example:
    - Parse directory → Read file → Generate code → Save file.
  - Test simple workflows using these chains.

#### **Step 9: Agent Integration**
- Create a LangChain agent using the tools built earlier.
- Allow the agent to dynamically decide which tool to use based on user input.
  - Example:
    - Input: "Generate a React component in this folder."
    - Workflow:
      1. Parse the folder.
      2. Generate the component.
      3. Save the file.

---

### **Phase 5: CLI Interface**
#### **Step 10: Console-Based Interaction**
- Build a CLI using NestJS Command or an external library like `commander.js`.
  - CLI commands:
    - `generate:react` → Generate a React component.
    - `edit:file` → Modify a specific file.
    - `run:setup` → Execute project setup commands.
- Link CLI commands to LangChain workflows or individual services.

---

### **Phase 6: Additional Requirements**
#### **Step 11: Directory Structure Parsing**
- Implement functionality to parse a directory structure and list all files and directories.
- Use this functionality to allow the user to specify a directory path in the console.

#### **Step 12: File Reading and Writing**
- Ensure the `FileService` can read and write files as required by the user commands.
- Implement error handling for scenarios like missing files or permission issues.

#### **Step 13: Command Execution**
- Implement the ability to run commands like setting up a NestJS project, installing dependencies, and running project creation commands.
- Ensure safety checks are in place to prevent malicious commands.

#### **Step 14: Code Generation and Editing**
- Use OpenAI function calling to generate and edit code based on user instructions.
- Ensure the generated code is saved correctly and modifications are applied as specified.

#### **Step 15: Handling Plain Text Instructions**
- Implement functionality to handle plain text instructions from the user.
- Use OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to interpret user commands.
  - Example:
    - Input: "Give me a React component in this folder."
    - Workflow:
      1. Parse the folder.
      2. Generate the component.
      3. Save the file.
    - Input: "Fix the backend API in this file."
    - Workflow:
      1. Read the file.
      2. Generate the required code modifications.
      3. Save the modified file.

#### **Step 16: Testing and Integration**
- Build the functionalities separately, test them, and then combine them.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better code management.
- Ensure interactions with the bot are through the console.
- Utilize OpenAI structured output and assistants API if necessary.
- Note: OpenAI assistants API may be useful for handling complex user interactions and improving the overall user experience.
